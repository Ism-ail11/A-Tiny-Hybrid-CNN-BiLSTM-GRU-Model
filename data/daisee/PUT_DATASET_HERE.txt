Place DAiSEE files here.

Expected structure (default config):
data/daisee/
  videos/            # video files, named with IDs used in label JSON (mp4/avi/mkv)
  labels/            # one or more JSON files: { video_id: 'Very Low'/'Low'/'High'/'Very High' } or {video_id: 0..3}

Notes:
- DAiSEE has usage terms. Download it from the official source and place it locally.
- If your IDs do not embed subject IDs, edit src/data/splits.py::infer_subject_id to match your naming.
